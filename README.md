# Data-visualization-project
Our group has gathered satellite data which compares time against radiance values consistently over a consistent part of the globe. These Satellites are from a collaborative NOAA &amp; NASA program. The two satellite images, Geostationary Operational Environment Satellites, R series, GOES 16 (Eastern), and GOES17 (Western) overlap in their readings. A pixel area of their overlap is chosen about their midpoint located over the equator. First visualization is a scatter plot of the mean temperature over this select region versus 10 minute snap-shot.The second level feature is to be able to display the histogram of the region of interest when user hovers the mouse over a point. Each red line is as an average for all the dots in a snapshot. The last feature is to program some unique identifier to find appropriate file names of the images that will display the day behavior as an aggregate feature.
